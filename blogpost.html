      <p class="lead">The essential Berlin photography tour: Berlin in one day</p>

      <p>If you ever happen to have the chance to photograph in Germany’s capital, then here is the Berlin Guide for Photography that lets you explore the most famous landmarks through Street Photography in this beautiful town. The Street Photography Community might be small in Berlin, but there is a rising interest in photography and photojournalism as well as workshops and classes. International Photographers are discovering this city as a Street Photography hotspot and with my Berlin Guide for Photography, I hope to support your stay and help you to enjoy Berlin from a Photographer’s perspective.</p>
      <p>Berlin is one of the most photographed cities in the world. But the city has many great spots and angles to shoot from other than the Brandenburg Gate and the TV Tower. </p>
     <p>What are the best locations for street photography in Berlin? The  amazing Berlin photo spots? I get these questions quite often, so I decided to write the Berlin photography guide, that I would want to read.  </p>
     <p>Many are popular spots for taking photographs. One of the most famous is the Oberbaumbrücke. Another is the Elsenbrücke, offering breath-taking panoramic views with the Molecule Men in front and the TV Tower in the background that are particularly impressive at sunset. The sun setting over the city is a popular motif, especially from the Modersohnbrücke. The Ebertbrücke in Berlin's Mitte district is another great spot to shoot the curves of the round Bode Museum at the northern tip of the Museum Island. A steamboat cruise is another great opportunity for plenty of photos, especially for water lovers. You'll get an entirely different perspective on the city on deck and might capture shots that can't be seen from the shore.

     </p>
     <p>Covering 892 square kilometres, Berlin is Germany's largest city. As you might imagine it's quite a challenge to capture such a massive area on camera, but if you're willing to climb up into the clouds, you'll be rewarded with a one-of-a-kind panorama. Sports enthusiasts might want to climb the bell tower in Berlin's Olympic park and enjoy the special views down on the Olympic Stadium. But Berlin has a few options available for those who go about their photography in a more leisurely way. For example, you can head up to a bar like the Klunkerkranich in trendy Neukölln and enjoy a cold drink as you watch the sun set over the city. Other roof terraces around the city offer even more opportunities for stunning shots from high up.</p>
        
     <p>Walk: Kottbusser Tor – Reichenberger Strasse – Mariannenstrasse–  Paul-Lincke Ufer – Maybachufer – Planufer – Admiralsbrücke 
     What to expect: Kottbusser Tor is easily the most notorious neighbourhood of Berlin, you will find anything here, drug dealers and drug addicts, Turkish immigrants, party people, artists, alternative lifestylers, tourists etc. Kottbusser Tor is quite active at night with a lot of bars and restaurants being open. As for the walk within some hundred meters the neighborhood changes into nice and gentrified. A lot of well known streetart between Kottbusser Tor and Schlesisches Strasse along Skalitzer Strasse. Summer evenings people hang out at Admiralsbrücke. Great atmosphere. Oranienstrasse (close to Kottbusser Tor) is well worth a visit at night (bars, clubs, restaurants).</p>
        
     
     <b>The essential Berlin photography tour: Berlin in one day</b>
     <p>Of course, bad weather provides the opportunity for great Berlin photography. Yet, let’s face it: There are deeply unpleasant combinations of “wet, cold, windy and dark” – also known as the Berlin winter. Here are my tips for nasty weather:

     Start at  central station. The central station of Berlin is a huge, very modern and open building with lots of glass and steel, always busy always safe. You can literally spend hours here.
        
     Head over to Hamburger Bahnhof former train station turned into a museum of modern art with a great coffee shop inside.</p>

        <p class="lead">In 1999, the old German Parliament building, the Reichstag, underwent its most dramatic and gorgeous renovation since its original construction</p>
      
        <p>The Reichstag building was completed in 1894 following German national unity and the establishment of the German Reich in 1871. Under the attentive eye of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Paul Wallot's Reichstag competition winner of 1882 was a synthesis of High Renaissance and classical motifs such as the façade of columned porticos. It already included a modern glass and steel dome. 
        Wallot finished the building after 23 years of construction, in 1894. In 1933 a fire destroyed the cupola and much of the building. Then, during the Second World War, bombing nearly left the Reichstag in ruins. And Although the building was repaired in 1960, the architects renovators did not use Wallot’s original design of the dome.

        The building's grandeur was accentuated by an imposing projecting columned entrance supporting a triangular gable and a wide flight of steps that must be climbed to reach the main entrance portal. The result was a four-wing structure with two inner courtyards and a central plenary chamber and an emperor's crown at a height of 75m on the lantern. Ironically, the building's site was considered slightly unfortunate at the time because its entrance was facing the wrong side – West - with its back to the imperial Schloss and the 19th century city centre. The famous inscription - "DEM DEUTSCHEN VOLK" - (to the German nation), a 1916 addition by Peter Behrens, still towers above the monumental entrance.
        
       </p>
        <p>
       Recently, the English architect Norman Foster (Manchester, 1935) was hired to put new spirit into the old Reichstag. The renovation gained international interest when his firm, Foster & Partners, started making both aesthetic and technological innovations to the dome. The elliptical ramps spiraling up the inside of the structure are meant to symbolically raise citizens up above their government..</p>
        
       <p>While working on the project he considered four key points: 1, the recognition that the German Parliament as one of the most important centers of democracy in the world; 2, the desire to make the workings of the government more accessible to German citizens; 3, the understanding of history as a force that changes buildings as well as nations; and 4, the necessity of making an energy efficient building, which is, according to Foster, “fundamental to our future.”</p>
  
       
       <p>Visitors to the Reichstag Building are not only able to admire its impressive architecture, but also view a range of artworks created by established German and foreign artists for the home of the German parliament - including, as a gesture to Berlin’s former four-power status, works by artists from the USA, France and Russia.</p>
       
       <p>The Reichstag has become an inspiration for architects around the world. The new technology in the dome works as a local power plant, capturing both solar and wind energy, and even makes use of energy converted from vegetable oil. In the end, it saves so much energy that it helps to power the neighboring buildings. The central cone in the beautiful cupola maintains a pleasant air temperature as well as consistent light throughout the year. Even at night, this cupola elegantly illuminates the Berlin skyline.</p>

        <p class="lead">Berlin leuchtet" & Festival of Lights</p>
      
        <p>In Berlin, a sightseeing tour at night is always a great experience. But there are certain occasions when the capital city turns into a city of light art, for example during the “Festival of lights” and the “Berlin Light Weeks”. Experience Berlin during the light spectacle, when the whole city shines in bright colours. Every year in September and October the light shows take place in Berlin: 2019 “Berlin leuchtet” (Berlin illuminated) runs from October 9th until 20th and the Festival of Lights runs from October 11th until the 20th. Then the famous sights, squares and many buildings are spectacularly illuminated: Brandenburg Gate, Berlin Cathedral, Gendarmenmarkt and many more. Our tip: Join a tour to the most beautiful places of the light shows.</p>
        
        <p>Every year, “Berlin leuchtet” lights up some of the city’s most impressive buildings with fancy illuminations, not just by artists from Berlin, but also international experts, giving the cityscape a colourful and exciting brilliance for two weeks in autumn. The spectacle with more than 80 illuminations annually attracts more than two million visitors and is one of the capital’s most popular events. Berlin can easily rival the festivals of light in other major international cities. “Berlin leuchtet” takes place every autumn, this year from 28 September to 14 October.
        Most of the light installations can be found around the city centre, with a particular focus on the most famous buildings and sights, such as the Brandenburg Gate and the Victory Column. A very special view can be had from the water, and boat tours during the festival of lights pass numerous illuminated buildings along the river Spree. Night tours of the city are on offer as part of the event: a must for tourists and locals alike. Not only can you admire the most beautiful and spectacular light installations, but also enjoy the city’s many other sights. Because the festival attracts more than two million visitors every year, it can sometimes get crowded on the streets. That means it’s best to leave the car at home and use public transport instead, which gets you quickly and easily to all the venues. Don’t miss the 3D Mapping Show at the Brandenburg Gate, the annual highlight of the festival. Eight projectors beam a light show lasting several minutes onto Berlin’s most famous landmark.

       </p>
       <strong>Pyronale</strong>
       <p>The stunning Pyronale World Fireworks Championship takes place against the imposing backdrop of the Olympic Stadium and historic Maifeld bell tower. Six international teams prepare some spectacularly creative displays with breathtaking effects in order to win the competition and the public's favor.

          <p class="lead">Nighlife - the best areas and clubs to stay and have fun in Berlin</p>
          <p>Brutal, crude, pulsating, freaky, exhausting, flamboyant and addictive, Berlin nightlife is capable of exhausting an entire dictionary of adjectives. The German capital is probably the nightlife capital of Europe and, maybe even the whole world. In Berlin, clubbing culture is a religion, techno is gospel and God, is a deejay.

          A multi-cultural metropolis of more than three million people, teeming with young people, with a very permissive night legislation and a recent history of tumultuous events have created the breeding ground for the perfect techno storm: nights that become full days of partying, world-famous deejays and a number and variety of venues to suit all tastes.  Choosing the best area to stay in Berlin will depend on your clubbing style. While techno kids and ravers will find paradise in Friedrichshain, around legendary Berghain, low-key alternative bar-goers will probably love areas like Schlesisches Tor and the LGBT crew will find Nollendorf Platz is the closest thing to heaven.</p>
        
          
         <strong>WARSCHAUER STRASSE – TECHNO PARADISE</strong>
          <p>Located in former East Berlin, Warschauer Strasse is the top nightlife area in the German Capital.

          Club kids, techno fans and live music venue lovers will all agree; Warschauer has got it all!
            
          During the weekends, hordes of club-goers pack the UBahn station on their way to their beloved discothèques. It’s the gateway to Berghain, but also to other Berliner techno institutions such as Watergate and Trésor..</p>
          
          <strong>Berghain - Where techno reigns and the limits of decadence are pushed</strong>
          <p>Deep, dark bass tones are seeping through the walls of the old East German power plant, giving the night revelers, patiently waiting outside, a hint of what’s hidden on the other side. The autumn air is cold and damp; the Berlin night impenetrably dark. But within these walls, a different kind of darkness awaits: a legendary club in old East Berlin, where techno reigns and the limits of decadence are constantly being pushed.</p>
          
          <p>For many people, it’s not the music but the ‘cool factor’ that attracts them to Berghain. Once there, they’re immersed in techno music, and hopefully they’ll enjoy that experience and get hooked. I see it sort of like a breeding ground for future generations of techno heads. And that is the enchanting of the club.</p>

          <p> Ironically, the building's site was considered slightly unfortunate at the time because its entrance was facing the wrong side – West - with its back to the imperial Schloss and the 19th century city centre. The famous inscription - "DEM DEUTSCHEN VOLK" - (to the German nation), a 1916 addition by Peter Behrens, still towers above the monumental entrance.</p>
          <p>One reason for Berghain’s success is the mythology that’s formed around it. Berghain and techno music have become part of pop culture, with ever-expanding press coverage in renowned publications such as Rolling Stone and The New Yorker. People are hungry to witness the hedonism of Berlin and to find out what goes on behind the concrete walls of Berghain.</p>
          

         <p>The area has a grungy, industrial feel to it and most of the venues in this area are located in old warehouses and factories. There’s nothing more Berliner than this.

         One of its top features is that, while being an eclectic party district, it is also very well-connected to the rest of town thanks to its nearby UBahn and SBahn stations.</p>
    
         <strong>KREUZBERG – HIPSTER BERLIN AT ITS FINEST</strong>
         <p>Kreuzberg, located in the south-central area of Berlin is synonymus with hipsters, alternative nightlife and party.

          This multicultural neighbourhood has been a haven for counter-culture since before German Reunification and has remained home of weird Berlin ever since. While there are some great clubs in Kreuzberg, the area is also known for its lower-key bar scene and its amazing food venues.</p>
         <p>The top areas to keep in your radar if you decide to stay in this alternative party heaven are definitely Schlesisches Tor, a street full of alternative bars and Kottbusser Tor Tor where hipster, poor-but-sexy and the downright weird meet every night.

         With regards to clubbing, you can’t go wrong in Kreuzberg with places like KitKatClub, Watergate or Club der Visionaere.</p>
         <strong>MITTE – FOR A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING</strong>
         <p>Mitte is the heart of Berlin. It literally translates as “middle” and it’s the best area to stay in Berlin for nightlife if you want to also do some sightseeing while in town, as it is the best connected area to see all the attractions the German capital has to offer. Although for the most part this district was on the East Berlin side of things, German Reunification has been synonymus with German Gentrification and Mitte is the place to go for some classy partying.</p>
         <p>Mitte is a large district, but from a nightlife perspective we can outline a few fun places to stay:

          Alexanderplatz, the very center of Berlin, still offers some underground venues and lots of bars. Rosenthaler Platz is a hipster and trendy area with lots of bars and restaurants, and the area around Oranienburger Tor concentrates many of the youthful (and slightly touristy) venues.</p>
          <strong>NOLLENDORF PLATZ – THE GAY HEART OF BERLIN</strong>
          <p>Nollendorf Platz and the whole district of Schöneberg have been the epicenter of gay life in Berlin since the 1920’s.

          Although LGBT nightlife is preset in every corner of the German capital; Schwuz, the big gay nightclub is in Neukölln, Berghain and Panoramabar are in Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg concentrates lots of the smaller LGBT-oriented bars. Schöneberg is by far the gayest district in Berlin. The area has tons of bars, clubs, shops and sex-oriented venues. It even features a few of the gay hotels of Berlin.</p>
